# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Part-Sales
Motorcycles—cool! SQL skills—definitely cool! This project allows me to combine both—very cool!

Working on behalf of a company that sells motorcycle parts, I'll dig into their data to help them understand their revenue streams. I'll build up a query to find out how much net revenue they are generating across their product lines, segregating by date and warehouse.
